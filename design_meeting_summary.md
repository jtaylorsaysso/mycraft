🌟 MYCRAFT PROJECT — FULL SUMMARY (So Far)
🎯 Core Idea

A non‑linear, open‑world sandbox people want to live in, not rush through.

Think:

    Minecraft freedom + Skyrim atmosphere + Fallout 4 building

Designed for:

    Kids and adults

    Casual players first, hardcore optional

    Creativity, exploration, and comfort over grind

🌍 World & Visual Style

    Stylized, readable visuals (Minecraft‑like shapes)

    Beautiful lighting and atmosphere (Skyrim‑like mood)

    Normal biomes and fantasy biomes

    Fantasy = magical and colorful, not scary

    Day/night cycle, weather

    No seizure‑trigger visuals (no heavy flashing or distortion)

Goal: a world players want to exist in and come back to.
🧭 Exploration & Structure

    Fully open world

    No forced linear quests

    Discover things naturally through exploration

    Points of Interest visible and inviting

    Landmarks that look good from far away

🧱 Building & Hoarding (Major Pillar)

    Chunk‑based build zones tied to POIs

    Modular + prefab building (Fallout‑style but improved)

    Everything can be:

        Picked up

        Broken down

        Upgraded

        Used as decoration

    Builds can be saved, reloaded, and seeded into world generation

    Hoarding and decorating are explicitly supported

⚔️ Combat Philosophy

    Arkham/Shadow‑style base

    Parry is optional, never mandatory

    No one‑hit kills

    Enemies are fun to fight, not sponges

    Casual‑friendly by default

    Some limb removal allowed, but stylized (box‑people/critters, not horror)

❤️ Health, Death & Difficulty

    Visible health bar (no bloody screen effects)

    Items recoverable after death (no time limit)

    Difficulty can be changed at any time

    Adaptive difficulty ideas (game reacts to player skill)

    Hardcore/survival mode is optional

Death = inconvenience, not punishment.
🧠 Skill System

    Small, simple skill tree (Fallout 4 / Spider‑Man style)

    Skills unlock options, not raw power

    Categories:

        Combat (choices, not parry spam)

        Traversal & exploration

        Loot / crafting / hoarding

        Building & world shaping

        Future “weird systems” tab

🐉 Weirdness (On Purpose)

    Fantasy + futuristic tech mashup

    Dragons, unicorns, strange mounts

    Missiles on dragons was suggested 😄

    RIFTS‑style lore explanation floated

📌 Design Rules Everyone Agreed On

    No forced linear gameplay

    No rage‑quit difficulty

    No grind for grind’s sake

    No microtransactions

    No mandatory parry systems

    Game must feel welcoming, not punishing

🧾 One‑Line Summary

    A beautiful, open sandbox where players explore, build, collect, decorate, and play their own way — safely, creatively, and for a long time.

Absolutely — here’s a clean, high‑level summary of everything discussed so far to get you fully caught up, Na 👋
🌍 Core Vision

An open‑world sandbox RPG that players can live in, not just finish.
Think Minecraft freedom + Skyrim fantasy + Fallout systems + light sci‑fi tech, with a playful tone and accessibility for kids and adults.

No strict linear quests. Exploration, building, and creativity come first.
🧱 World & Exploration

    Open world, non‑linear, curiosity‑driven

    Visually pleasing environments
    Minecraft readability meets Skyrim beauty

    Mix of:

        Normal landscapes

        Fantasy biomes

        Light futuristic elements

    Designed so players want to live there (decorate, settle, revisit)

🏗️ Building & Crafting (Big Pillar)

    Fallout‑style settlement/building system, but better

    Players can:

        Build freely (not quest‑locked)

        Customize Points of Interest (POIs)

        Save/reload builds or seed them into world generation

    Every item can be:

        Upgraded

        Broken down for parts

        Used as decoration / hoarded

    Prefabs are fine, but deep customization is required

⚔️ Combat Philosophy

    Fun > punishment

    No one‑hit kills

    Enemies should be challenging but fair

    Casual‑friendly, with optional hardcore modes

    Arkham/Shadow‑style combat base is scaffolded, BUT:

        Parry is optional, not mandatory

        Multiple valid playstyles

    Some gore is okay (e.g. limbs popping off boxy enemies), but not horror‑level

🧠 Difficulty & Accessibility

    Difficulty can be changed anytime

    Optional survival/hardcore mode for advanced players

    Dynamic difficulty ideas:

        Game subtly adapts based on how well you play

    No seizure‑inducing effects

    Health bar preferred (no red vignette / fading vision)

🧟 Enemies

    Zombies are wanted (for Jenna 😄)

    Avoid Resident‑Evil‑style extreme horror

    Must look like zombies if they are zombies

    Enemies should never feel unfair or spongey

🎒 Loot, Items & Currency

    One unified currency (Fallout caps‑style)

    Not rare or grindy

    Collectibles matter:

        Clothing

        Cosmetics

        Décor

    Item recovery on death:

        Elden Ring–style

        No time limit

🌳 Skills & Progression

    Small, simple skill tree

    Think Fallout 4 or Spider‑Man

    No massive AC Valhalla‑style sprawl

    Skills may include:

        Combat

        Traversal

        Loot/crafting

        Future systems

🧠 Design Values (Important)

    No rage‑quits

    No “play it the right way” punishment

    Encourage experimentation

    Players should feel safe being creative

    Designed for:

        Kids

        Adults

        Casual players

        Builders

        Explorers

        Optional maniacs 😈

🎮 Overall Goal

A game people:

    Come back to

    Show friends & family

    Talk about their builds

    Feel ownership over

Not “I beat it” —
but “I live there.”
