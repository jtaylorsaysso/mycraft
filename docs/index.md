## 💡 Documentation Philosophy

MyCraft documentation is designed for **absolute beginners first**:

1. **Visual-first**: Screenshots, videos, and examples over walls of text
2. **Progressive depth**: Start simple, reveal complexity as you grow
3. **Learn by doing**: Hands-on tutorials over reference docs
4. **Advanced docs available**: Technical details for those who want them
