# Design Pillars

## 1. Foundations Are Law

**Input, movement, and camera define the game’s trust contract.**

* Polished first, protected always
* Predictable, responsive, and invariant across contexts
* No feature may degrade moment-to-moment control or spatial reasoning

**Veto test:**

> Does this affect input clarity, movement feel, or camera trust in any way?

If yes, it must justify itself *against the foundations*, not alongside them.

---

## 2. Emergence From Few Rules

**Depth arises from interaction, not accumulation.**

* Small number of orthogonal mechanics
* Systems compose instead of stack
* Content configures rules rather than inventing exceptions

**Veto test:**

> Does this increase the expressive space of existing systems?

If it only adds surface variety, it fails.

---

## 3. Meaningful, Costly Choice

**Choice is only meaningful if it excludes alternatives.**

* Asymmetry is intentional
* Opportunity cost is enforced
* Choices affect *approach*, not baseline viability

**Veto test:**

> What permanent or costly tradeoff does this introduce?

If the answer is “none,” it is not a real choice.

---

## 4. Player as Problem Solver

**The player is expected to reason, experiment, and adapt.**

* Failure teaches
* Unintended solutions are allowed
* Constraints create creativity

**Veto test:**

> Does this allow the player to be clever in multiple ways?

If it funnels toward a single solution, it is suspect.

---

## 5. Comprehension, Communication, and Mastery

**The game communicates state clearly, rewards understanding, and plateaus intentionally.**

* Outcomes are predictable and explainable
* Information is surfaced only when actionable
* Lore and mechanics reinforce each other
* Mastery comes from use, not growth

**Veto test:**

> Can a thoughtful player understand, predict, and improve without UI clutter or stat inflation?

If not, something is misaligned.

## Sanity Check

If a feature:

* Preserves foundations
* Composes with existing systems
* Forces tradeoffs
* Encourages problem solving
* Communicates cleanly and caps mastery

…it belongs.

If it fails **any one** of those, it is either:

* Premature
* Overdesigned
* Or for a different game

---

## 6. Social Playfulness

**Interaction should be expressive, not just utilitarian.**

* **Toys over Tools**: Mechanics can be fun without being "optimal".
* **Expression is Gameplay**: How you look and act is content for others.
* **Positive Sum**: Helping others (or harmlessly pranking them) feels good.

**Veto test:**

> Does this feature create a memorable moment between players?

If it's purely solitary or stats-based, it misses the social mark.

## Sanity Check

If a feature:

* Preserves foundations
* Composes with existing systems
* Forces tradeoffs
* Encourages problem solving
* Communicates cleanly and caps mastery
* **Creates social sparks**

…it belongs.
